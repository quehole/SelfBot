I cannot begin to comprehend why you just pinged me on the Discord app. It seems the divide between you and I (on intellectual levels) is greater than I could have ever imagined. While I was busy creating the next big thing, you to humor me with 'comedy gold,' as others have said recently. Well, you certainly have failed to humor me â€” in fact, you have actually made me quite upset. It is for that I applaud you, I truly do. You may have just been the first of the cesspool of commoners to finally pique my attention, the first whose lack of brain cells has finally caught the interest of a higher being. Well, I'm listening. What is it today, 'Funnyman?' Is it another mediocre meme?");
